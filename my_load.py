"""Materialize a dataset under a Narrowing.

Two entry points share one read core:
  - `load(info)` — the legacy/declarative path. Builds a Narrowing from whatever
    `subset()` recorded in `info.selected_dimensions` and reads it. Byte-identical
    to the pre-Narrowing loader.
  - `materialize(info, narrowing)` — the interpreter's path. Reads under a
    planner-built Narrowing: the structural cuts (projection, grid crop+stride,
    particle subsample) are pushed into the read; the computed cuts arrive as
    `narrowing.post_ops` and are applied AFTER the read in the exact order the
    spec wrote them (RowMask / RowSample / VoxelMask).

The read-set is `project` (the output variables) plus whatever the post-read
ops need (threshold vars, bbox position vars) — mask-only extras are read, used,
then dropped (positions are kept: render needs them). The per-format work lives
in adapters.py; this module copies metadata and routes to the adapter.
