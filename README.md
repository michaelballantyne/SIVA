# SIVA

SIVA lets you build scientific visualizations by talking to an AI. You
describe what you want to see, the AI writes declarative pipeline code, and
you iterate together — exploring data, tuning parameters, and refining the
picture through conversation.

Here's what a pipeline file looks like — this volume-renders a CT scan of a
bonsai tree with a terrain colormap and gradient-enhanced opacity:

```python
data = source("vtkXMLImageDataReader", FileName="bonsai.vti")

show(data, "bonsai", representation="Volume",
    color_by="density", scalar_range=(20, 200), lut="terrain",
    opacity_function=[(0, 0.0), (18, 0.0), (26, 0.01), (36, 0.05),
                      (48, 0.13), (60, 0.26), (80, 0.48),
                      (110, 0.68), (150, 0.84), (220, 0.96)],
    gradient_opacity=True, shade=True)

background(0.02, 0.02, 0.05)
```

SIVA has two parts:

1. **A pipeline DSL** — a concise Python syntax for VTK visualization.
   You describe sources, filters, and display properties declaratively;
   SIVA wires up the VTK objects for you.

2. **An MCP server** — exposes the DSL and data query tools to any AI assistant
   via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). The assistant
   can load data, explore field statistics, execute pipeline code, adjust the
   camera, and see screenshots — all through tool calls.

## Setup

SIVA works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude Code, Claude Desktop,
etc.). Point your assistant at the SIVA server and start a conversation in
the directory where your data lives.

### 1. Install

```bash
cd /path/to/SIVA
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure your AI assistant

Add SIVA to your project's `.mcp.json` (or your assistant's MCP settings),
pointing at the Python from the venv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "SIVA": {
      "command": "/path/to/SIVA/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "siva.server", "--workdir", "/path/to/your/data"]
    }
  }
}
```

This opens a live VTK window where you can see the visualization update as
the AI builds it. `--workdir` sets the working directory for the session —
the server discovers data files there, and the pipeline files the AI writes
land there too. (Omit it to use the directory you launched the assistant
from.)

**Model tip:** With Claude Code, Opus at low reasoning effort has given the
best balance of speed and skill in our experience — smarter pipeline choices
than Sonnet without the latency of higher reasoning effort.

### 3. Start a conversation

Open a chat with your AI assistant (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) and
ask it to visualize your data:

> **You:** Load output.30000.vts and show me what's in it.
>
> **AI:** *(calls load(), describes fields, dimensions, value ranges)*
>
> **You:** Show me the temperature field — I want to see where it's hottest.
>
> **AI:** *(writes a pipeline with threshold + volume rendering, shows screenshot)*
>
> **You:** Can you add streamlines showing the wind flow through the hot region?
>
> **AI:** *(adds compute_velocity + stream_tracer to the pipeline, iterates)*

## Running pipelines directly

You can also run pipeline files directly, without the MCP server.
Activate the venv (or use its Python) and run:

```bash
# Open an interactive VTK window
python -m siva.run pipeline.py

# Save a screenshot
python -m siva.run pipeline.py -o output.png

# Custom resolution
python -m siva.run pipeline.py -o output.png --size 3840x2160
```

Useful for batch rendering, testing pipelines, or using SIVA without
an AI assistant.

## What it supports

- **Data formats:** VTK structured grids (`.vts`), image data (`.vti`),
  polydata (`.vtp`), unstructured grids (`.vtu`), rectilinear grids (`.vtr`),
  raw binary volumes
- **Visualization techniques:** isosurfaces, thresholds, volume rendering,
  cross-section slices, streamlines, glyphs, colormapping, clipping
- **Derived quantities:** vector fields from scalar components, vorticity,
  gradient magnitude, individual vector components
- **Interactivity:** camera control, opacity adjustment, colormap changes,
  text annotations, multi-view support
