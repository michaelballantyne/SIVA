"""Trame rendering backend for SIVA.

`TrameRenderer` implements the full public Renderer interface (see
``tests/test_renderer_interface.py``) by serving each view as an interactive
browser view through trame's ``VtkRemoteView`` (server-side VTK rendering
streamed to the browser over a websocket). It reuses the desktop
``Renderer``'s scene-management logic (actors, volumes, scalar bars, camera,
LightKit) and diverges only where trame requires it: window/interactor
creation flags, the event loop, ``dispatch``, ``render``, ``screenshot``, and
teardown.

Architecture
------------
Everything is served from **one port** by **one shared trame server**
(``_SharedTrameApp``): the trame client assets, the websocket, every view,
the view-index page (``/views``) and its thumbnails (``/thumb/<name>``).
This makes SIVA easy to reach from a container or SSH session — forward a
single (optionally pinned via ``--trame-port``) port and every view is
reachable through it.

Per-view addressing uses trame's native multi-layout mechanism rather than
per-view servers: a trame "layout" is just a named Vue template stored in
the server's shared reactive state, and the generic trame client picks
which template to render from the ``ui`` URL query parameter (default
``main``). Each ``TrameRenderer`` therefore registers one ``DivLayout``
(template) named after its view, containing one ``VtkRemoteView`` bound to
its own ``vtkRenderWindow``, and its browser URL is ``/?ui=<view>``. The
SIVA view named ``main`` maps to trame's default template name, so the bare
root URL shows it. Because all views share one reactive state namespace,
everything per-view (the widget ``ref``, the frame-push callable) is kept
on the renderer instance, never in shared/controller slots.

Every ``TrameRenderer`` (every view) shares **one** asyncio event loop
(``run_shared_loop()``, run by ``server.main()`` on the real process main
thread before any view is constructed). The one trame server is scheduled
onto that shared loop (``exec_mode="task"``) rather than getting its own OS
thread. All VTK access from other threads (the MCP thread, the hot-reload
build worker) is marshalled onto that loop's thread via ``dispatch``, which
uses ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` (with a
run-inline-if-already-on-owner check to avoid self-deadlock, mirroring the
desktop work-queue pattern in ``renderer.py``).

This one design is required on macOS and is simply used everywhere, rather
than branching on platform: VTK's Cocoa backend creates a native
``NSWindow`` during *any* ``vtkRenderWindow.Render()`` call -- even with
``SetOffScreenRendering(True)`` and no interactor at all -- and Cocoa
requires that happen on the process main thread. Critically, this includes
renders that **wslink triggers internally** in response to a browser client
connecting or interacting (initial frame push, resize, drag) -- those never
go through SIVA's own ``render()``/``dispatch()`` at all, so no amount of
wrapping SIVA's own call sites would be sufficient; the loop those renders
run on has to *be* the main thread. Since ``server.main()`` is always
called directly from the process entry point (no thread wrapper), whichever
thread calls ``run_shared_loop()`` there already *is* the real main thread
on every platform, so satisfying macOS costs nothing elsewhere -- there is
no Linux-specific per-view-thread path to maintain.

The trame server is embedded with the accommodations documented in the
design investigation:

- ``show_connection_info=False`` and ``open_browser=False`` keep **stdout
  clean** — SIVA speaks MCP JSON-RPC on stdio and any banner would corrupt
  it. All diagnostics go to ``.siva/server.log``.
- ``timeout=0`` disables wslink's default 300s idle auto-shutdown.
- ``host="127.0.0.1"`` binds loopback only by default; ``--trame-host
  0.0.0.0`` (via ``configure_shared_app()``) opts into binding all
  interfaces, needed inside a container whose port is published with
  ``docker run -p`` (published ports arrive on the container's external
  interface, not its loopback).
- ``thread=True`` tells wslink it is not on the main thread (no signal
  handlers) and to create its own event loop there.
- ``port=0`` (the default) auto-picks a free port; ``--trame-port`` pins it
  (via ``configure_shared_app()``). The real port is read back from
  ``server.port`` once the server is ready.

When ``VSCODE_PROXY_URI`` is set (code-server / Coder terminals), the
proxied URL is computed by substituting ``{{port}}`` and reported alongside
the localhost URL, via ``siva.view_index.resolve_url`` (shared with the
view-index page so the substitution logic lives in one place).

The shared server starts with the first view and keeps serving until the
process exits: destroying a view tears down its VTK objects and replaces
its template with a "view closed" notice (pushed live to any connected
browser), but never stops the server — other views stay reachable on the
same port throughout.
